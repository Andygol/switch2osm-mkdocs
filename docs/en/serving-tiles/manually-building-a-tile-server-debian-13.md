!!! info ""
    This page describes how to install, setup and configure all the necessary software to operate your own tile server. These step-by-step instructions were written for [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/){: target=_blank} 13 (trixie), and were tested in August 2025.

## Software installation

The OSM tile server stack is a collection of programs and libraries that work together to create a tile server. As so often with OpenStreetMap, there are many ways to achieve this goal, and nearly all of the components have alternatives that have various specific advantages and disadvantages. This tutorial describes the most standard version that is similar to that used on the main OpenStreetMap.org tile servers.

It consists of 5 main components: `mod_tile`, `renderd`, `mapnik`, `osm2pgsql` and a `postgresql/postgis` database. Mod_tile is an apache module that serves cached tiles and decides which tiles need re-rendering&nbsp;– either because they are not yet cached or because they are outdated. Renderd provides a priority queueing system for different sorts of requests to manage and smooth out the load from rendering requests. Mapnik is the software library that does the actual rendering and is used by `renderd`.

These instructions have been written and tested against a new {{ dist }} server. If you have got other versions of some software already installed (perhaps you upgraded from an earlier version some time ago, or you set up some PPAs to load from) then you may need to make some adjustments.

In order to build these components, a variety of dependencies need to be installed first.

Debian may not come with `sudo` by default, so we may need to log on as `root` to do the first part:

```sh
--8<-- "docs/assets/serving-tiles/debian13-deps.txt"
```

While still logged on as root we'll ensure that the main user account that we are using can `sudo` to root. You'll want to change `youruseraccount` to whatever account you are using in the line below. Don't try and do everything below as `root`; it won't work.

```sh
usermod -aG sudo youruseraccount
exit
```

That returns to your user account. Logoff and logon again, and then:

```sh
sudo whoami
```

That should return `root`.

At this point, a couple of new accounts have been added. You can see them with `tail /etc/passwd`. `postgres` is used for managing the databases that we use to hold data for rendering. `_renderd` is used for the `renderd` daemon, and we'll need to make sure lots of the commands below are run as that user.

Now you need to create a postgis database. The defaults of various programs assume the database is called `gis` and we will use the same convention in this tutorial, although this is not necessary. Note that `_renderd` below matches the user that the `renderd` daemon will run from.

```sh
sudo -u postgres -i
createuser _renderd
createdb -E UTF8 -O _renderd gis
```

While still working as the `postgres` user, set up PostGIS on the PostgreSQL database:

```sh
psql
```

(that'll put you at a `postgres=#` prompt)

```sh
\c gis
```

(it'll answer "You are now connected to database 'gis' as user 'postgres'".)

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

(it'll answer CREATE EXTENSION)

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION hstore;
```

(it'll answer CREATE EXTENSION)

```sql
ALTER TABLE geometry_columns OWNER TO _renderd;
```

(it'll answer ALTER TABLE)

```sql
ALTER TABLE spatial_ref_sys OWNER TO _renderd;
```

(it'll answer ALTER TABLE)

```sh
\q
```

(it'll exit psql and go back to a normal Linux prompt)

```sh
exit
```

(to exit back to be the user that we were before we did `sudo -u postgres -i` above)

## Mapnik

Mapnik was installed above. We'll check that it has been installed correctly by doing this:

```py
python3
>>> import mapnik
>>>
```

If python replies with the second chevron prompt `>>>` and without errors, then Mapnik library was found by Python. Congratulations! You can leave Python with this command:

```py
>>> quit()
```

## Stylesheet configuration

Now that all of the necessary software is installed, you will need to download and configure a stylesheet.

The style we'll use here is the one that use by the "standard" map on the openstreetmap.org website. It's chosen because it's well documented, and should work anywhere in the world (including in places with non-latin placenames). There are a couple of downsides though - it's very much a compromise designed to work globally, and it's quite complicated to understand and modify, should you need to do that.

The home of "OpenStreetMap Carto" on the web is <https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/>{: target=_blank}, and it has it's own installation instructions at <https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/INSTALL.md>{: target=_blank}, although we'll cover everything that needs to be done here.

Here we're assuming that we're storing the stylesheet details in a directory below `~/src` below the home directory of the whichever non-root account you are using:

```sh
mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto
cd openstreetmap-carto
git pull --all
git switch --detach v5.9.0
```

The "git switch" is needed because that's the latest release that you can see at OpenStreetMap, but OSM Carto has actually moved to a different database format. See OSM Carto's [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for the newer version.  The old format is called `pgsql`, the new one `flex`; later we'll get a [warning](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/faq.html#the-pgsql-output-is-deprecated-what-does-that-mean) from `osm2pgsql` about that.

Next, we'll check that we have installed a suitable version of the `carto` compiler.

```sh
carto -v
```

That should respond with a number that is at least as high as:

```log
1.2.0
```

Then we convert the carto project into something that Mapnik can understand:

```sh
carto project.mml > mapnik.xml
```

You now have a Mapnik XML stylesheet at `/home/youraccountname/src/openstreetmap-carto/mapnik.xml`.

## Loading data

Initially, we'll load only a small amount of test data. Other download locations are available, but `download.geofabrik.de` has a wide range of options. In this example we'll download the data for Azerbaijan, which is currently about 32Mb.

Browse to <https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/azerbaijan.html>{: target=_blank} and note the "This file was last modified" date (e.g. "{{ dl_timestamp }}"). We'll need that later if we want to update the database with people's subsequent changes to OpenStreetMap. Download it as follows:

```sh
mkdir ~/data
cd ~/data
wget https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/azerbaijan-latest.osm.pbf
```

Next, we need to make sure that the `_renderd` user can access the stylesheet. In order to do this it needs access to wherever you downloaded it, and by default it won't have access to your home directory. If it's in `src` below your user account then

```sh
chmod o+rx ~
```

will work. If you don't want to do this you can move it and amend references to the file locations in subsequent commands.

The following command will insert the OpenStreetMap data you downloaded earlier into the database. This step is very disk I/O intensive; importing the full planet might take many hours, days or weeks depending on the hardware. For smaller extracts the import time is much faster accordingly, and you may need to experiment with different `-C` values to fit within your machine's available memory. Note that the `_renderd` user is used for this process.

```sh
sudo -u _renderd \
    osm2pgsql -d gis --create --slim  -G --hstore \
    --tag-transform-script \
        ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.lua \
    -C 2500 --number-processes 1 \
    -S ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.style \
    ~/data/azerbaijan-latest.osm.pbf
```

It's worth explaining a little bit about what those options mean:

`-d gis`
: The database to work with (`gis` used to be the default; now it must be specified).

`--create`
: Load data into an empty database rather than trying to append to an existing one.

`--slim`
: osm2pgsql can use different table layouts; `slim` tables works for rendering.

`-G`
: Determines how multipolygons are processed.

`--hstore`
: Allows tags for which there are no explicit database columns to be used for rendering.

`--tag-transform-script ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.lua`
: Defines the lua script used for tag processing. This an easy is a way to process OSM tags before the style itself processes them, making the style logic potentially much simpler.

`-C 2500`
: Allocate 2.5 Gb of memory to osm2pgsql to the import process. If you have less memory you could try a smaller number, and if the import process is killed because it runs out of memory you'll need to try a smaller number or a smaller OSM extract.

`--number-processes 1`
: Use 1 CPU. If you have more cores available you can use more.

`-S ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.style`
: Create the database columns in this file (actually these are unchanged from "openstreetmap-carto")

`~/data/azerbaijan-latest.osm.pbf`
: The final argument is the data file to load.

While running that you'll get the [warning](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/faq.html#the-pgsql-output-is-deprecated-what-does-that-mean) that was mentioned above.  The latest version of "OSM Carto" in development has been changed to use the "flex" output, but the version on the OpenStreetMap website (which this guide is designed to mirror) does not yet.

That command will complete with something like "Osm2pgsql took 238s overall".

### Creating indexes

Some extra indexes now need to be [applied manually](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v530---2021-01-28){: target=_blank}:

```sh
cd ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/
sudo -u _renderd psql -d gis -f indexes.sql
```

It should respond with `CREATE INDEX` 16 times.

## Database functions

In version 5.9.0 of “OSM Carto” (released October 2024), some functions need to be loaded into the database manually. These can be added using:

```sh
cd ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/
sudo -u _renderd psql -d gis -f functions.sql
```

### Shapefile download

Although most of the data used to create the map is directly from the OpenStreetMap data file that you downloaded above, some shapefiles for things like low-zoom country boundaries are still needed. To download and index these, using the same account as we used previously:

```sh
cd ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/
mkdir data
sudo chown _renderd data
sudo -u _renderd scripts/get-external-data.py
```

This process involves a sizable download and may take some time - not much will appear on the screen when it is running. Some data will go directly into the database, and some will go into a “data” directory below “openstreetmap-carto”. If there is a problem here, then the Natural Earth data may have moved - look at [this issue](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/issues/581#issuecomment-913988101){: target=_blank} and similar ones at Natural Earth for more details. If you need to change the Natural Earth download location your copy of [this file](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/external-data.yml){: target=_blank} is the one to edit.

### Fonts

Fonts need to be installed manually, like this:

```sh
cd ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/
scripts/get-fonts.sh
```

Due to a [current issue](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/5013) you might get an error at the very end of that, but it won't adversely affect the display of any current OSM data.

Our test data area (Azerbaijan) was chosen both because it was a small area and because some place names in that region have names containing non-latin characters.

## Setting up your webserver

### Configure renderd

The config file for `renderd` on {{ dist }} is `/etc/renderd.conf`. Edit that with a text editor such as nano:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/renderd.conf
```

Add a section like the following at the end:

```ini
[s2o]
URI=/hot/
TILEDIR=/var/lib/mod_tile
XML=/home/accountname/src/openstreetmap-carto/mapnik.xml
HOST=localhost
TILESIZE=256
MAXZOOM=20
```

The location of the XML file `/home/accountname/src/openstreetmap-carto/mapnik.xml` will need to be changed to the actual location on your system. You can change `[s2o]` and `URI=/hot/` as well if you like. If you want to render more than one set of tiles from one server you can - just add another section like `[s2o]` with a different name referring to a different map style. If you want it to refer to a different database to the default `gis` you can, but that's out of the scope of this document. If you've only got 4Gb or so of memory, you'll also want to reduce `num_threads` to 2. `URI=/hot/` was chosen so that the tiles generated here can more easily be used in place of the HOT tile layer at OpenStreetMap.org. You can use something else here, but `/hot/` is as good as anything.

The location of the Mapnik plugins directory now varies between different architectures.  You can type ``

```sh
sudo updatedb
locate mapnik/4.0/input
```

to find the location on your server, and then edit `/etc/renderd.conf` so that `plugins_dir` in the `[mapnik]` section is correct, perhaps something like:


```ini
[mapnik]
plugins_dir=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/mapnik/4.0/input
```

If this is set incorrectly or missing among the errors that you might get when trying to render tiles are:

!!! warning ""
    An error occurred while loading the map layer 's2o': Could not create datasource for type: 'postgis' (no datasource plugin directories have been successfully registered) encountered during parsing of layer 'landcover-low-zoom'

Other errors might include tiles not rendering properly and `renderd` using an unexpectedly large amount of memory.

Now that we've told `renderd` how to react to tile rendering requests we need to tell the Apache web server to send them.  Unfortunately, the configuration for this has been removed from recent versions of `mod_tile`. It can, however, currently be installed from here

```sh
cd /etc/apache2/conf-available/
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstreetmap/mod_tile/python-implementation/etc/apache2/renderd.conf
sudo a2enconf renderd
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

### Making sure that you can see debug messages

It'd be really useful at this point to be able to see the output from the tile rendering process, including any errors. By default, with recent `mod_tile` versions, this is turned off. To turn it on:

```sh
sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/renderd.service
```

If it's not already there below `[Service]`, add:

```ini
Environment=G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all
```

Then run these commands to reload the configuration:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart renderd
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Configuring Apache

```sh
sudo mkdir /var/lib/mod_tile
sudo chown _renderd /var/lib/mod_tile
```

After doing so, restart `renderd`:

```sh
sudo /etc/init.d/renderd restart
```

If you look at the system log, you should see messages from the `renderd` service. Note that in the last couple of Debian versions, messages are no longer written to `/var/log/syslog` by default - to follow messages as they are written, do this:

```sh
sudo journalctl -ef
```

See [here](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#changes-to-system-logging){: target=_blank}: for more details.

```sh
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

Using `#!sh sudo journalctl -ef` you should see a line such as:

```log
 Aug 15 12:16:08 h19 apachectl[14590]: [Fri Aug 15 12:16:08.655816 2025] [tile:notice] [pid 14590:tid 14590] Loading tile config s2o at /hot/ for zooms 0 - 20 from tile directory /var/lib/mod_tile with extension .png and mime type image/png
```

If this does not appear it probably means that the configuration file for mod_tile `/etc/apache2/conf-available/renderd.conf` is either not set up or enabled properly - see the `wget` section above.

Next, point a web browser at `http://yourserveripaddress/index.html` (change `yourserveripaddress` to your actual server address). You should see "Apache2 Debian Default Page".

!!! tip
    If you don't know what IP address it will have been assigned, you can likely use `ip address` to find out – if the network configuration is not too complicated it'll probably be the `inet addr` that is not `127.0.0.1`.

If you're using a server at a hosting provider then it's possible that your server's internal address will be different to the external address that has been allocated to you, but that external IP address will have already been sent to you, and it'll probably be the one that you're accessing the server on currently.

Note that this is just the `http` (port 80) site – you'll need to do a little bit more Apache configuration if you want to enable `https`, but that's out of the scope of these instructions. However, if you use "Let's Encrypt" to issue certificates, then the process of setting that up can also configure the Apache HTTPS site as well.

Next, point a web browser at: `http://yourserveripaddress/hot/0/0/0.png`

You'll need to edit that of course if you changed `URI=/hot/` above. You should see a small map of the world. If you don't, investigate the errors that it displays. These will most likely be permissions errors, or perhaps related to accidentally missing some steps from the instructions above. If you don't get a tile and get other errors again, save the full output in a Pastebin and ask a question about the problem somewhere like [`community.openstreetmap.org`](https://community.openstreetmap.org){: target=_blank}.

## Viewing tiles

In order to see tiles, we’ll cheat and use an html file `sample_leaflet.html` that allows you to view a very simple map. To obtain this:

```sh
cd /var/www/html
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mod_tile/switch2osm/extra/sample_leaflet.html
sudo nano sample_leaflet.html
```

Edit so that the IP address matches `your.server.address` rather than just saying `127.0.0.1`. That should allow you to access this server from others. Then browse to `http://your.server.address/sample_leaflet.html`.

The initial map display will take a little while. You'll be able to zoom in and out, but depending on server speed some tiles may initially display as grey because they can't be rendered in time for the browser. However, once done, they’ll be ready for the next time that they are needed. If you look in the system log you should see requests for tiles.

If desired, you can increase the setting `ModTileRequestTimeout` and `ModTileMissingRequestTimeout` in `/etc/apache2/conf-available/renderd.conf` from 3 and 10 seconds to perhaps 30 or 60, in order to wait longer for tiles to be rendered in the background before a grey tile is given to the user. Make sure you `#!sh sudo service renderd restart` and `#!sh sudo service apache2 restart` after changing it.

Congratulations. Head over to the [using tiles](/using-tiles/index.md) section to create a map that uses your new tile server.
